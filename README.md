- I have 6 years of experience in data analytics, automation, and product marketing across Gen AI and SaaS startups.  
- I currently work at @ [Alltius](https://www.alltius.ai) where I built full-funnel analytics, scaling SQLs 10x and web traffic 10x using PostHog & MixPanel.
- Currently working on building AI workflows, AI voice agents and technical blogs at Alltius. 
- Previously worked @ [Nanonets](https://www.nanonets.com) where I grew signups from 0 to 300+/month using SQL dashboards and behavioral insights.  
- At @ [AbbVie](https://www.abbvie.com), I built an unsupervised Bayesian model based on research papers to predict disease trajectories using 100M+ patient records-now in production.  
- Iâ€™ve automated 250+ marketing and analytics workflows using Zapier, Bedrock, Gumloop & OpenAI APIs.  
- I hold an MS in Business Analytics from [UC Irvine](https://merage.uci.edu/), an MBA from [IIM Calcutta](https://www.iimcal.ac.in/), and a BTech from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/).
